        <article class="article"> Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented
             programming language that is designed to have as few implementation 
             dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language
              intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning 
              that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java 
              without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled
               to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless 
               of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar
                to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
                The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and 
                runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional
                 compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular 
                 programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for 
                 client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
