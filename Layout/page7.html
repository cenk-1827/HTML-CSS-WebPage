        <article class="article"> Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose
             programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. It was
              designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In 
              Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was 
              developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.

            Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time 
            compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
            procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the
             creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, and Lisp.
