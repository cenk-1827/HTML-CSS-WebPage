        <article class="article"> Lua is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming
             language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform,
              since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a 
              relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.

            Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software applications
             to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. It provided the basic 
             facilities of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or 
             domain-specific features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for 
             extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was 
             intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused 
             on improving its speed, portability, extensibility, and ease-of-use in development.
