        <article class="article"> C++ is a general-purpose programming language
             created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension
              of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has 
              expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented,
               generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level
                memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled 
                language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free
                 Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it 
                 is available on many platforms.

            C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded,
             resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency
             , and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been 
             found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software 
             infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop 
             applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases),
              and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
