        <article class="article"> C is a general-purpose computer programming
             language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains
              very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly 
              reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting 
              use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though 
              decreasingly for application software, and is common in computer 
              architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest
               microcontrollers and embedded systems.

            A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at 
            Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities 
            running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix 
            operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It 
            has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers
             available for almost all modern computer architectures and operating systems.
              C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International
               Organization for Standardization (ISO).
