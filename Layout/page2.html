        <article class="article"> C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm 
            programming language. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing,
             lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, 
             object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming
              disciplines.
              
            The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from 
            Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard
             by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft
              introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of 
              which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source
               products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project
                called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime
                 environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, 
                 Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler),
                  and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which 
                  support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also
                   joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET. </article>
