        <article class="article"> Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose 
            programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
            with the use of significant indentation.

            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple 
            programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
            object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a 
            "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
            
            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor
             to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 
             0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features 
             such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference
              counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major 
              revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.
               Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020. </article>
